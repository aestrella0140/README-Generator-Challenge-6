# <README Generator>

## Description

This project was to demonstrate multiple factors in node.js. One factor that was demonstrated was exporting and importing files to one another. By pulling data from generateMarkdown.js I was able to plug in license badges and the link to the badges. From the index.js I demonstrated a prompt in the terminal a series of inputs and choices of licenses.
